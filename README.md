# Passenger Counter App

This is a simple Passenger Counter App built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

I created this project to practice the fundamentals of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. It helped me learn how to declare variables, handle user interactions with buttons, and use the `onclick` event to update the page. As I progressed, I improved the app by applying custom styling with CSS and adding more JavaScript functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- Count passengers by clicking the **Increment** button
- Reset or save the count (optional if you add these features later)
- Clean and simple interface using HTML and CSS
- Real-time counter updates with JavaScript

## 💡 What I Learned

- Writing and using JavaScript variables
- Working with event listeners (`onclick`)
- Manipulating the DOM
- Styling elements with CSS

## 📁 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
